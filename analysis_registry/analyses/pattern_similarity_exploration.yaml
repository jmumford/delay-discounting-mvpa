description: >
  Exploring the behavior of the RSA matrices and analyses we plan to run
  more widely.  Focusing on relationships that should be highly powered 
  such as correlations with RT and differences by choice.

hypothesis: >
   Do relationships we expect to be present in the motor ROI exist?  
   Do RSA values differ by choice and do they relate to RT distance?
conclusion: >
  WIP, but aside from a weak correlation between BOLD/RT distances, 
  I don't see much here.  The secondary analyses further explore that 
  the patterns seen in the distance matrices are driven by onset
  time differences.  Among other things, similar patterns persist
  even when voxels are randomly selected across the brain.  Perhaps
  the poor highpass filter (higher range causes collinearity increases)
  is part of the issue, but I do not know.
