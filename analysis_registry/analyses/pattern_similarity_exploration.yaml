name: "Reality check analyses in motor ROI for pattern similarity"
description: >
  Exploring the behavior of the RSA matrices and analyses we plan to run
  more widely.  Focusing on relationships that should be highly powered 
  such as correlations with RT and differences by choice.

output_dir: "analyses/pattern_similarity_exploration (contains summary pdf)"
hypothesis: >
   Do relationships we expect to be present in the motor ROI exist?  
   Do RSA values differ by choice and do they relate to RT distance?
conclusion: >
  WIP, but aside from a weak correlation between BOLD/RT distances, 
  I don't see much here.
